# valorant-cliphub

A website for hosting a collection of Valorant gameplay clips and educational videos. The site should feature a clean, gamer-oriented design with a focus on showcasing video content prominently. The color scheme should mirror the dark, neon aesthetics of Valorant itself, with reds, blacks, and neon blues. Navigation should be straightforward, allowing users to easily find and watch different gameplay clips and educational content. A section for tutorials and tips for improving at Valorant should also be included, with options for categorizing videos by skill level or game aspect (e.g., aiming, strategy, character guides).
